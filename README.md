# FreeLLM 

This repository provides a crowd-sourced collection of LLM/SLM proxy endpoints, powered by LiteLLM, to help everyday developers experiment with AI without worrying about token limits or infrastructure costs.
These endpoints aggregate compute from volunteered machines — home PCs, laptops, edge devices, and more — to offer free (whenever possible) access for prototyping and learning.

⚠️ Disclaimer
These endpoints are intended strictly for experimentation and education.
There are no SLAs, no uptime guarantees, and usage is entirely at your own risk. Malicious or abusive usage is strictly prohibited.
