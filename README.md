# FreeLLM 

This repository provides a crowd-sourced collection of LLM/SLM proxy endpoints, powered by LiteLLM, to help everyday developers experiment with AI without worrying about token limits or infrastructure costs.
These endpoints aggregate compute from volunteered machines — home PCs, laptops, edge devices, and more — to offer free (whenever possible) access for prototyping and learning.

# Why This Project Exists

Most developers cannot afford GPU instances or paid API credits just to learn or test ideas.
This project solves that by:

* Crowd-sourcing inference capacity
* Providing open access API endpoints
* Allowing developers to prototype without worrying about token budgets
* Making compute a community resource, not a barrier

# 🤝 Contributing

We welcome all contributions:

* Add new proxy endpoints
* Share scripts for running nodes
* Add support for vLLM / LM Studio / llama.cpp
* Improve routing logic
* Add monitoring or observability
* Submit documentation or examples

# ⚠️ Important Disclaimer

This project is meant ONLY for educational and experimental use. There is:

* No SLA or uptime guarantee
* No guarantee of response quality
* No guarantee of privacy
* No production reliability
* Use entirely at your own risk

Sensitive, private, or business-critical data must not be sent to these endpoints.
